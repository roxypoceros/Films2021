                Synopsis:
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">Sometime after the events of the first film, Buster Moon is thriving with his new theatre. However, he fails to impress talent scout Suki, who tells him he would not make it in Redshore City. Buster, encouraged by Nana Noodleman, reunites the singers who competed in the first film, except for Mike, and takes them to the city.

                They sneak in for an audition with entertainment mogul Jimmy Crystal. As Jimmy is uninterested in Buster's original show pitch, Gunter suggests a space-themed musical that includes songs from Clay Calloway, a legendary rock star who has not been seen in 15 years. Intrigued, and assuming Calloway will be a part of the show, Jimmy greenlights it, telling them to have the show up and running within three weeks.
                
                During production, Rosita develops a fear of heights during rehearsal and is unable to keep on her role, which Moon begrudgingly gives to Jimmy's daughter Porsha on his insistence while Rosita is delegated to a minor role. Meanwhile, Johnny has been assigned to work with top choreographer Klaus Kickenklober for his part in the show but senses that Klaus dislikes him due to his inability to dance. Johnny comes across a street dancer named Nooshy, who agrees to help him out. Meena has been cast in a romantic scene with Darius, a self-absorbed actor. Having never been in love before, Meena is unable to get the feelings across during their scene. She later meets and falls in love with an ice cream vendor named Alfonso...</p>
