                Synopsis:
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">
                In the late 1950s,[14] timid sea monster child Luca Paguro herds goatfish off the coast of the Italian
                town of Portorosso. His parents forbid him from approaching the surface, fearing that he might be hunted
                by humans. One day, Luca meets Alberto Scorfano, a fellow sea monster child who lives alone in an
                abandoned tower on dry land. When Alberto encourages Luca to venture out of the ocean, it is revealed
                that sea monsters turn into humans as long as they are dry. Luca and Alberto begin hanging out and
                become friends, and they wish to own a Vespa and travel around the world.

                Upon discovering their son's actions, Luca's parents decide to send him to live in the deep with his
                uncle. In retaliation, Luca runs away with Alberto to hide out in Portorosso. The boys run afoul of
                Ercole Visconti, the local bully and five-time champion of the Portorosso Cup, a children's triathlon of
                swimming, pasta-eating, and biking. When Ercole tries to soak Luca in a fountain, Giulia Marcovaldo, a
                young girl, stops him. In hopes of winning the money needed for a Vespa, the boys team up with Giulia
                for the triathlon.

                Giulia invites them to stay at her house and introduces her fisherman father, Massimo, who holds grudges
                towards sea monsters. Meanwhile, Luca's parents infiltrate the town to find their son. Giulia and Luca
                bond over their love of learning, making Alberto jealous. When Luca shows interest in attending school,
                Alberto intentionally reveals his sea monster form to Giulia to prevent it. Unwilling to give himself
                up, Luca feigns surprise to keep being with Giulia, and a betrayed Alberto flees as Ercole's gang show
                up and try to hunt him. Heartbroken, Alberto trashes everything in his hiding place. Shortly after
                Giulia finds out that Luca is a sea monster as well, and sends him away for his safety.

                Luca attempts to reconcile with Alberto, who is revealed to have been abandoned by his father long ago.
                He promises to win the Vespa to rebuild their friendship...</p>
