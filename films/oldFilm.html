            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Guy and Prisca Cappa are going through a divorce. To avoid saddening their young children⁠ Maddox and
                Trent⁠, the couple takes them to a tropical resort as a final family vacation. At their hotel, Guy and
                Prisca are given complimentary drinks and the children befriend the resort manager's nephew, Idlib. At
                night, Maddox and Trent overhear their parents arguing and play a message decoding game with Idlib.

                The next morning, the manager invites the family to a secluded beach where three additional parties are
                present: rapper "Mid-Sized Sedan", and a female companion; surgeon Charles, his wife Chrystal, their
                young daughter Kara, and Charles's mother Agnes; and Jarin and Patricia Carmichael, a close-knit husband
                and wife. Trent⁠ discovers the corpse of Mid-Sized Sedan's companion. Charles grows suspicious of
                Mid-Sized Sedan, who reveals that he has been experiencing nosebleeds because of his hemophilia. After
                the children rapidly turn into teenagers and Agnes suddenly dies, the families conclude that the beach
                is rapidly aging them, with the occupants undergoing the equivalent of one year of aging every 30
                minutes. At least one member of each family has an underlying medical condition. They discover that
                trying to leave will result in them blacking out and waking up back to where they left.

                In a fit of rage, Charles cuts Mid-Sized Sedan with a pocket knife and the group watches as his injury
                quickly heals. After Prisca develops an abdominal tumor, Charles performs a successful surgery to remove
                it. Mid-Sized Sedan discovers that the body of his companion has fully decomposed in a matter of hours.
                Kara and Trent continue to age...</p>
