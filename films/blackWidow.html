            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">
                In 1995, super soldier Alexei Shostakov and Black Widow Melina Vostokoff work as Russian undercover
                agents, posing as a family in Ohio with Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova as their daughters. They
                steal S.H.I.E.L.D. intel and escape to Cuba where their boss, General Dreykov, has Romanoff and Belova
                taken to the Red Room for training. In the following decades, Shostakov is imprisoned in Russia while
                Romanoff and Belova become successful, dangerous assassins. Romanoff eventually defects to S.H.I.E.L.D.
                after helping Clint Barton bomb Dreykov's Budapest office, which apparently kills Dreykov and his young
                daughter Antonia.

                In 2016, Romanoff is a fugitive for violating the Sokovia Accords.[b] She escapes from U.S. Secretary of
                State Thaddeus Ross and flees to a safehouse in Norway supplied by Rick Mason. Meanwhile, Belova kills a
                rogue former Black Widow but comes in contact with a synthetic gas that neutralizes the Red Room's
                chemical mind-control agent. Belova sends antidote vials to Romanoff, hoping she and the Avengers can
                free the other Widows, and goes into hiding. When Romanoff is unknowingly driving with the vials in her
                car, Red Room agent Taskmaster attacks her. Romanoff escapes from Taskmaster and realizes that the vials
                came from Budapest. There she finds Belova, who reveals that Dreykov is alive and the Red Room is still
                active. Black Widows and Taskmaster attack them, but Romanoff and Belova evade them and meet with Mason,
                who supplies them with a helicopter.

                Romanoff and Belova break Shostakov out of prison to learn Dreykov's location, and he directs them to
                Vostokoff, who lives on a farm outside Saint Petersburg. There she is refining the chemical mind control
                process used on the Widows. Vostokoff alerts Dreykov...</p>
