            <p class="paragraph">
                After Quentin Beck frames Peter Parker for his murder and reveals Parker's identity as Spider-Man,
                Parker, his girlfriend MJ Watson, best friend Ned Leeds, and aunt May are interrogated by the Department
                of Damage Control. Lawyer Matt Murdock gets Parker's charges dropped, but the group grapples with
                negative publicity. After Parker, MJ, and Ned's MIT applications are rejected, Parker goes to the New
                York Sanctum to ask Stephen Strange for help. Strange casts a spell that would make everyone forget
                Parker is Spider-Man, but it is corrupted when Parker repeatedly requests alterations to let his loved
                ones retain their memories. Strange contains the spell to stop it and makes Parker leave.

                Parker tries to convince an MIT administrator to reconsider MJ and Ned's applications but is attacked by
                Otto Octavius. Octavius rips Parker's nanotechnology from his Iron Spider suit, which bonds with his
                mechanical tentacles and allows Parker to disable them. As Norman Osborn arrives and attacks, Strange
                teleports Parker back to the Sanctum and locks Octavius in a cell next to Curt Connors. Strange explains
                that before he could contain the corrupted spell, it summoned people from other universes within the
                multiverse who know Spider-Man's identity. He orders Parker, MJ, and Ned to find and capture them; they
                locate and retrieve Max Dillon and Flint Marko.

                Osborn reclaims control of himself from his split Green Goblin personality. He goes to a F.E.A.S.T.
                building, where May comforts him before Parker...</p>
