                Synopsis:
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">In 1964 England, Estella is a creative child with a talent for fashion, but is
                ostracized for her unusual hair and develops a nefarious streak. Her mother, Catherine, decides to move
                them to London, stopping at a party at Hellman Hall to ask the host for money. Sneaking inside, Estella
                loses her mother’s necklace while being chased by the host's ferocious Dalmatians, which push Catherine
                off a cliffside balcony to her death. Blaming herself, Estella runs away to London and befriends street
                urchins and brothers Jasper and Horace.

                Ten years later in 1974, Estella practices thievery and grifts with Jasper and Horace, honing her
                fashion skills by designing their disguises, alongside their dogs, Buddy and Wink. For her birthday,
                Jasper and Horace get her a job at the Liberty department store, but Estella is made a janitor and
                denied the chance to use her talents. She drunkenly redecorates a window display and impresses the
                Baroness von Hellman—a renowned but authoritarian haute couture designer—who offers her a coveted job at
                her fashion house. Estella gains the Baroness's confidence but notices her wearing Catherine’s necklace,
                which the Baroness claims is a family heirloom that an employee once stole. Estella asks Jasper and
                Horace to help retrieve the necklace during the Baroness's Black and White Ball...</p>
